This repo will be updated with the full LiDAR metric extraction code for LiDAR datasets in ASCII format suitable for use with Python.

The extraction function is called ASCIILiMET, written and adapted from several LiDAR metrics published in the literature and other descriptive structural metrics.

The initial code was written in Google Collab and should be adapted for Python use with Jupiter Notebook.
If these codes are used do well to cite this article (). It is currently under review and the link will be made available as soon as it is accepted.
